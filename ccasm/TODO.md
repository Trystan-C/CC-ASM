## Documentation
* CONTRIBUTING.md for adding instructions/tests.
* Update README.md with system overview/explanation. <-- Include basic background.

## Future Work 
* Given multiple input source files, assemble should produce a single object file.
* Update branching to use absolute addresses, not immediate data.
* Make instruction byte values generated, so adding new instructions is less painful.
* Add redstone trap codes.
* Add sleep trap code.
* File-descriptor system for interacting with peripherals.
* Add common interface for developing drivers for each peripheral.
